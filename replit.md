## User Preferences
- **Persistent memory system**: Bot MUST have persistent memory to remember users across sessions and build personality profiles
- **Self-reflection through mirroring**: Core purpose is reflection of self through the bot's learned personality mirror
- **Original voice system**: Maintain only the 4 approved voices (James, Brian, Alexandra, Carla)
- **Voice functionality**: ElevenLabs voices must work properly - user extremely frustrated with voice system failures
- **CRITICAL STABILITY ISSUE**: User experiencing repeated app breakdowns and runtime errors - app stability is top priority
- **Critical priority**: Voice system and component errors causing significant user frustration - must maintain working state
- **Communication style**: Direct, technical communication preferred - user extremely frustrated with app instability
- **User expectation**: App should work consistently without breaking when attempting basic interactions like voice chat
- **VOICE SYSTEM FIXED**: Implemented Web Audio API-based recorder that creates proper WAV files - bypasses MediaRecorder WebM issues completely
- **PERSONALITY REFLECTION RESTORED**: Reverted to working static analysis system that was functional 12 hours ago - provides comprehensive psychological insights without AI dependency
- **Identity reflection**: Bot should reflect user's persona, identity, and mannerisms over time
