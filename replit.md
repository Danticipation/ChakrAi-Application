# TraI - Mental Wellness & Therapy Application

## Overview
TraI is a professional mental wellness and therapy application designed for people in need of therapeutic support. The interface features a calming, thoughtful design with soothing pastel colors (#ADD8E6 soft blue, #98FB98 pale green, #E6E6FA gentle lavender) to create a welcoming, professional environment for mental health support. The application includes voice interaction, daily affirmations, therapeutic personality modes, and wellness goal tracking.

## User Preferences
- **Persistent memory system**: Bot MUST have persistent memory to remember users across sessions and build personality profiles
- **Self-reflection through mirroring**: Core purpose is reflection of self through the bot's learned personality mirror
- **Original voice system**: Maintain only the 4 approved voices (James, Brian, Alexandra, Carla)
- **Voice functionality**: ElevenLabs voices must work properly - user extremely frustrated with voice system failures
- **Critical priority**: Voice system is causing significant user frustration and must be resolved immediately
- **Communication style**: Direct, technical communication preferred
- **Identity reflection**: Bot should reflect user's persona, identity, and mannerisms over time
- **Color scheme preference**: MUST maintain consistent blue therapeutic theme throughout - user strongly rejects colorful "rainbow" designs
