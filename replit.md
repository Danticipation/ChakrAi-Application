# Chakrai - Mental Wellness & Therapy Application

## Overview
Chakrai is a professional mental wellness and therapy application designed for individuals seeking therapeutic support. It features a calming, thoughtful design with soothing pastel colors to create a welcoming, professional environment. Key capabilities include voice interaction, daily affirmations, therapeutic personality modes, and wellness goal tracking. The project aims to provide comprehensive mental health support, leveraging AI for personalized insights and fostering self-reflection.

## User Preferences
- **Persistent memory system**: Bot MUST have persistent memory to remember users across sessions and build personality profiles
- **Self-reflection through mirroring**: Core purpose is reflection of self through the bot's learned personality mirror
- **Original voice system**: Maintain only the 4 approved voices (James, Brian, Alexandra, Carla)
- **Voice functionality**: ElevenLabs voices must work properly - user extremely frustrated with voice system failures
- **CRITICAL STABILITY ISSUE**: User experiencing repeated app breakdowns and runtime errors - app stability is top priority
- **Critical priority**: Voice system and component errors causing significant user frustration - must maintain working state
- **Communication style**: Direct, technical communication preferred - user extremely frustrated with app instability
- **User expectation**: App should work consistently without breaking when attempting basic interactions like voice chat
- **VOICE SYSTEM FIXED**: Implemented Web Audio API-based recorder that creates proper WAV files - bypasses MediaRecorder WebM issues completely
- **Identity reflection**: Bot should reflect user's persona, identity, and mannerisms over time
- **Color scheme preference**: MUST maintain consistent blue therapeutic theme throughout - user strongly rejects colorful "rainbow" designs

## System Architecture
The application is built with a React frontend (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and an Express backend (PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM).

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Calming pastel color scheme: soft blue (#ADD8E6), pale green (#98FB98), gentle lavender (#E6E6FA).
- Consistent blue therapeutic theme for visual cohesion.
- Modular `Layout.tsx` for component structure and error boundaries.
- Collapsible sidebar navigation with 6 intuitive sections for organized access.
- Professional, space-optimized layouts with touch-friendly interaction targets.
- Engaging UI with shimmering silver borders, glass morphism effects, and subtle animations (e.g., neon cursor trail, sparkling stars background).
- Luxury typography system with Inter and Playfair Display fonts for a refined look, and Source Code Pro for character clarity.
- Dynamic theming system with rich color palettes and theme-independent progress bars.
- Mobile-first design with responsive layouts, optimized touch targets, and enhanced scrolling.
- Accessible design with ARIA compliance, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
