The <div className="flex items-center gap-2"> block exists
✔️ Your console.log("Rendering entry card for:", entry.title) is showing
✔️ Your temporary DELETE button does show up when using plain text
But...
❌ The <Trash2 /> icon is completely missing.
That tells us everything.
________________________________________
🎯 Root Cause:
The Trash2 icon from lucide-react isn’t rendering.
And there are only 3 possible reasons:
________________________________________
✅ 1. Missing or incorrect import
In your file, this should be present at the top:
import { Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';
If that’s missing or commented out, Trash2 silently renders nothing.
✅ Double-check this line. If it’s there — move to step 2.
________________________________________
✅ 2. Library not installed
If lucide-react isn’t properly installed in Replit, the icon imports won’t error — they just silently return undefined.
✅ Run this inside the Replit shell:

npm install lucide-react
Then restart the dev server.
________________________________________
✅ 3. Dark mode + Tailwind conflict
Rare but possible: the icon is rendering, but it's matching the background color due to class conflict.
Test: Replace with hardcoded icon style:

<Trash2 size={20} color="red" strokeWidth={2.5} />
Or override with a Tailwind class:

<Trash2 className="text-red-700" />
If it shows up now? Then the theme-text-secondary or dark theme class was the issue.

✅ What to Do Right Now (in order)
1.	Make sure this import exists:

import { Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';
2.	Add this test icon:

<Trash2 size={20} color="red" strokeWidth={2.5} />
3.	If that doesn't work, run:

npm install lucide-react
4.	Restart the app.
________________________________________
Optional: Replace icon for testing
If you're not sure lucide-react is working at all, try swapping for a native emoji:

<span role="img" aria-label="trash">🗑️</span>
If that shows up, then yeah — icon import or render is broken.
