Handoff Document: ChakrAI Personality Analysis Issue
Project Context
ChakrAI is a mental wellness application with React frontend and Express backend. The user is extremely frustrated with system instability and needs the app ready for test user deployment.

Current Critical Issue
Personality Analysis System Breakdown: The personality reflection feature that was previously working has degraded to producing generic, formulaic responses instead of deep psychological insights.

What Happened
Previous State: Personality analysis was working and providing comprehensive, detailed psychological insights
Current State: OpenAI API is technically functional but generating template-like, generic responses
User Frustration: User has lost confidence in the editor's ability to maintain system integrity
Failed Attempts: Multiple attempts to fix OpenAI prompting have not restored the quality of analysis
Technical Details
File: server/routes/analytics.js - personality reflection endpoint
API: OpenAI GPT-4o integration is working (confirmed with API calls)
Problem: Responses lack depth, specificity, and genuine psychological insight
Data: User has 4 authentic journal entries for analysis (user ID 107)
What User Wants
Real AI analysis that provides genuine psychological insights
NOT static text or pre-written responses
Deep, personalized analysis based on actual journal content
Comprehensive insights about communication patterns, emotional states, growth opportunities
What User DOES NOT Want
Mock or placeholder data
Generic template responses
Static analysis text
Further system modifications without clear direction
Next Steps for New Agent
DO NOT modify files without explicit permission
Investigate why OpenAI is producing formulaic responses vs. genuine analysis
Focus on improving prompt engineering or model parameters to get authentic psychological insights
Consider alternative approaches (different models, multi-step analysis, etc.)
Test thoroughly before implementing any changes
User's Communication Style
Direct, technical communication preferred
Extremely frustrated with app instability
Wants working solutions, not experiments
Values system stability over new features
Current System Status
App is running and functional
All other features appear stable
Only personality analysis quality is degraded
User has authentic journal data for testing
The user needs someone who can restore genuine AI psychological analysis without breaking the working system.
