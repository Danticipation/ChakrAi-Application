Categories of Questions TRAI Could Ask
1️⃣ Personality & Lifestyle (like a dating app but deeper)
If your friends had to describe you in 3 words, what would they say?

Are you more of a morning person, a night owl, or neither?

What’s your go-to comfort food on a rough day?

What’s one hobby or activity that instantly makes you lose track of time?

Would you say you recharge more around people or alone?

When you’re stressed, what’s your first instinct—move, talk, shut down, or distract?

2️⃣ Emotional Awareness & Coping
How do you usually recognize when you’re not doing well emotionally?

What’s one thing that almost always helps when you’re upset?

Do you like when people check in with you, or do you prefer space?

Do you process emotions more by thinking, talking, or feeling them out?

What’s your relationship with change—exciting, scary, or both?

3️⃣ Relationship Patterns & Support Systems
Who in your life do you feel the safest opening up to?

Do you currently have people who support your mental wellness journey?

What’s your love language (giving or receiving)—words, touch, time, gifts, or acts of service?

Are you more likely to vent or to seek solutions when you talk to someone?

4️⃣ Goals, Dreams, and Values
What’s one goal (big or small) you’re working toward right now?

What’s a value or belief that’s very important to you?

If nothing was holding you back, what’s a life change you’d make today?

Are you more future-focused, present-focused, or reflective of the past?

Do you prefer clear plans or going with the flow?

5️⃣ Random Fun (to make TRAI feel playful & warm)
Coffee, tea, or energy drinks—or none?

Mountains, beaches, cities, or forests?

Would you rather binge a TV series, read a book, or play a game on a lazy day?

If you could instantly master any skill, what would it be?

What song or artist do you play when you need to get in a good mood?

6️⃣ AI Therapy Preferences (so TRAI can tailor its style)
Would you like me to challenge your thinking sometimes or focus more on support?

Do you prefer gentle encouragement or tough love?

Would you like check-ins daily, weekly, or only when you start a session?

Should I reflect your feelings back to you often, or mostly listen?

Do you want me to ask follow-up questions about your answers, or keep it light?

💡 Why These Work
✔ Voluntary = low-pressure
✔ Builds a “profile” for the AI so it feels like it remembers them
✔ Creates hooks for future conversations (“Hey, last time you said you love hiking. Been on any good trails lately?”)
✔ Feels like part therapist, part friend, part coach
