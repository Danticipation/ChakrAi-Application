ðŸ§  Likely Culprit: CSS / Theme / Parent Container Issue
Your code for the delete button in renderEntryCard looks like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    handleDeleteClick(entry);
  }}
  className="p-1 rounded text-red-500 hover:text-red-700 hover:bg-red-50 dark:hover:bg-red-900/20 transition-colors"
  title="Delete entry"
>
  <Trash2 size={16} />
</button>
And that should work perfectly.

But if you're not seeing the icon, here's what could be causing it:

âœ… 1. Lucide Icon Not Rendering
Sometimes lucide-react icons donâ€™t render at all if:

The icon component is not properly imported

The containing component (e.g. <Trash2 />) renders but outputs nothing due to a theme issue or display constraint

Fix/Test:
Replace it temporarily with text to confirm button exists:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    handleDeleteClick(entry);
  }}
  className="p-1 bg-red-100 text-red-700 rounded"
>
  DELETE
</button>
If this renders? âœ… Then the issue is with the icon rendering.

âœ… 2. Check Parent div Flex Properties
Sometimes the parent of your buttons (flex items-center gap-2) is:

Hidden by overflow

Collapsing due to flex misalignment

Wrap the whole action block with a background temporarily:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-yellow-100">
  ...
</div>
If you now see the buttons? âœ… Then itâ€™s layout-related.

âœ… 3. Dark Theme CSS Conflict
Your button uses:

tsx
Copy
Edit
className="... hover:bg-red-50 dark:hover:bg-red-900/20 ..."
But if your theme is dark and your red-900/20 is blending into a black background, you wonâ€™t see the button even though itâ€™s there.

Temporarily change the button background:

tsx
Copy
Edit
className="bg-white text-red-700"
Just to confirm visibility.

âœ… 4. Check Button Container Visibility
Sometimes parent containers (especially in modals or card rows) are affected by:

overflow: hidden

z-index

Incorrect flex layout

Use dev tools (Inspect Element) on one card and look for:

The delete buttonâ€™s HTML existing but with display: none

It being outside the visible card due to layout break

ðŸ”¨ If All Else Fails: Replace the JSX Block
Hereâ€™s a drop-in version you can paste inside renderEntryCard() to test:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 p-2">
  <button
    onClick={() => alert('View')}
    className="px-2 py-1 bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 rounded"
  >
    View
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => alert('Edit')}
    className="px-2 py-1 bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700 rounded"
  >
    Edit
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => alert('Delete')}
    className="px-2 py-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded"
  >
    Delete
  </button>
</div>
If this works, then weâ€™ll rebuild your icon version step-by-step.

ðŸ§¼ Final Suggestions
Console.log inside renderEntryCard() to make sure itâ€™s even being called:

tsx
Copy
Edit
console.log("Rendering entry card for:", entry.title);
If not being called? Youâ€™ve got a rendering issue.

If being called but button not visible? CSS/layout/visibility issue.
