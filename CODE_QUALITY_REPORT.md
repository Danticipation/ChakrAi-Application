## Phase 3: Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETE

### Performance Systems
- **Memory Management**: `memoryOptimization.ts` with automatic garbage collection
- **Performance Monitoring**: `performanceMonitor.ts` with real-time metrics
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system monitoring with external API status
- **Caching**: In-memory caching with TTL and automatic cleanup
- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient connection management for expensive operations

### Performance Metrics
- 🚀 Memory usage monitoring with automatic cleanup
- ⏱️ Request performance tracking with slow query detection
- 💾 Intelligent caching with configurable TTL
