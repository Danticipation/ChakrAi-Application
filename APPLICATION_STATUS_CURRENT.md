  - `/api/personality-insights` - Basic personality data
- Static file serving from `client/dist`

**2. Frontend Application ‚úÖ**
- React app loads and renders
- Full navigation system with collapsible sidebar
- Mobile-responsive design with bottom navigation
- Theme system with 6 luxury themes
- Voice selector integration (ElevenLabs ready)

**3. Core Features Available ‚úÖ**
- **Dashboard:** Wellness overview with metrics

## üö® STABILITY ASSESSMENT

### **What Needs Immediate Attention**

**1. Database Connection ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Database connections may be unstable
- RLS (Row Level Security) errors in server logs
- Need to verify PostgreSQL connectivity

**2. API Backend Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Chat functionality needs OpenAI API connection
- Voice endpoints need ElevenLabs API integration
- Data persistence needs database verification

**3. Environment Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Environment variables need verification:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
  ```

**4. Build Process ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Current server uses simple JavaScript server
- Main TypeScript server needs tsx dependency fix
- Client build process needs verification

npm run dev:full
```

### **File Structure Status**
```
‚úÖ /server/ - Backend code (TypeScript)
‚úÖ /client/ - Frontend React app
‚úÖ /client/dist/ - Built frontend files
‚úÖ /deprecated/ - Removed Piper files
‚úÖ /server-simple.js - Working simple server
‚úÖ Package.json - Clean dependencies
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **To Get a Stable MVP:**

1. **Fix Development Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install tsx --save-dev
   npm run dev:full  # Should work after tsx install
   ```

2. **Connect Essential APIs**
   - Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - Test `/api/chat` endpoint

3. **Verify Database**
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` connection
   - Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
   - Test user session creation

4. **Test Core Flow**
   - User opens app ‚Üí Dashboard loads
   - User clicks chat ‚Üí Can send message
   - AI responds ‚Üí Voice synthesis works
   - Data persists ‚Üí Reload shows history

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Focus on Usability First**
- Get the core chat experience working reliably
- Ensure data persistence works
- Polish the dashboard with real user data
- Test on multiple devices for responsiveness

### **Avoid Feature Creep**
- Don't add 3D landscapes until core features work
- Skip advanced analytics until basic tracking works
- Hold off on subscription system until MVP is stable
- Delay complex animations until performance is optimized

### **Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to have 5 features that work perfectly
- Than 50 features that are buggy or unstable
- Focus on user experience and reliability
- Build trust through consistent functionality
