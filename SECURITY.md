# Security & Compliance Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures, privacy protections, and compliance frameworks implemented in TraI - Mental Wellness Companion Application.

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
TraI implements a zero-knowledge security model where user data remains encrypted and inaccessible to system administrators.

**Core Principles:**
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted before transmission
- **User-Controlled Keys**: Encryption keys never leave user devices
- **No Server-Side Decryption**: Backend cannot decrypt user therapeutic data
- **Forward Secrecy**: Key rotation ensures historical data protection

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Client-side encryption using AES-256-GCM
const encryptData = async (data, userKey) => {
  const algorithm = 'AES-256-GCM';
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const dataBuffer = encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(data));
  
  const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: algorithm, iv: crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12)) },
    userKey,
    dataBuffer
  );
  
  return encrypted;
};
```

### Data Encryption Standards

**At Rest:**
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all therapeutic data
- **PBKDF2** key derivation with 100,000 rounds
- **Unique salt** generation per user account
- **Database-level encryption** for additional protection

**In Transit:**
- **TLS 1.3** for all client-server communications
- **Certificate pinning** for API endpoints
- **HSTS** headers for secure connection enforcement
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data transmission

**In Memory:**
- **Secure memory allocation** for cryptographic operations
- **Automatic memory clearing** after processing
- **Protected key storage** using Web Crypto API
- **Session isolation** between users

### Authentication & Authorization

**Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- **WebAuthn** support for hardware security keys
- **Biometric authentication** on supported devices
- **Backup recovery codes** for account recovery

**Session Management:**
- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times
- **Refresh token rotation** for extended sessions
- **Device fingerprinting** for anomaly detection
- **Automatic logout** after inactivity periods

**Access Controls:**
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for different user types
- **Principle of least privilege** for system access
- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Granular permissions** for data sharing

## Privacy Protection

### Differential Privacy
TraI implements differential privacy to enable anonymous analytics while protecting individual user privacy.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Laplace Mechanism**: ε = 1.0 for general analytics
- **Gaussian Mechanism**: δ = 0.00001 for sensitive queries
- **Privacy Budget Management**: Automatic budget allocation and tracking
- **Cohort Minimums**: Minimum 10 users for any aggregated report

**Privacy Guarantees:**
```python
# Example differential privacy implementation
def add_laplace_noise(value, sensitivity, epsilon):
    scale = sensitivity / epsilon
    noise = numpy.random.laplace(0, scale)
    return value + noise

# Analytics query with privacy protection
def get_anonymous_mood_trends(time_period):
    raw_data = query_mood_data(time_period)
    privacy_budget = get_privacy_budget('mood_trends')
    
    if privacy_budget < REQUIRED_EPSILON:
        raise PrivacyBudgetExceeded()
    
    # Add calibrated noise to protect privacy
    noisy_data = add_laplace_noise(
        raw_data, 
        sensitivity=1.0, 
        epsilon=privacy_budget
    )
    
    update_privacy_budget('mood_trends', REQUIRED_EPSILON)
    return noisy_data
```

### Data Minimization
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data collected only for specified therapeutic purposes
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic deletion of data after defined periods
- **Anonymization**: Irreversible anonymization of research data
- **Selective Sharing**: Users control what data is shared with whom

### Consent Management
- **Granular Consent**: Separate consent for different data types and uses
- **Withdraw Consent**: Users can revoke consent at any time
- **Consent Auditing**: Complete audit trail of consent decisions
- **Clear Communication**: Plain language privacy notices

## Compliance Frameworks

### GDPR Compliance (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Article 25 - Data Protection by Design:**
- **Privacy by default** settings for all new accounts
- **Built-in privacy** protections in system architecture
- **Regular privacy impact** assessments

**Data Subject Rights:**
- **Right to Access**: Users can export all their data
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can correct inaccurate data
- **Right to Erasure**: Complete data deletion upon request
- **Right to Portability**: Data export in standard formats
- **Right to Object**: Opt-out of specific data processing

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
// GDPR data export implementation
export const exportUserData = async (userId: string) => {
  const userData = await gatherAllUserData(userId);
  
  return {
    personalData: userData.profile,
    journalEntries: userData.journal,
    moodData: userData.moods,
    conversationHistory: userData.chats,
    preferences: userData.settings,
    consentHistory: userData.consents,
    exportDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    format: "JSON",
    retention: "User can request deletion at any time"
