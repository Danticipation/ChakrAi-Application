OK so here's an update over the past 48 hours or so So well actually let me go a little bit further back than that. So my wife and I were separated for about A year She moved out of our house to  into an apartment closer to her job, It was convenient for her. so I went from hotel hopping to moving back into my home. Everything was going well, I had a couple of friends staying with me they were helping pay the bills and then my wife decided that she was going to move back into the home that we own together. So we're currently living together the friends moved out because it just didn't really work out. they weren't very comfortable to say the least she can be quite aggressive and quite let's just leave it at aggressive. So the other day a friend of mine that has a 8 month old baby is in some trouble and needs a place to stay She's in a relationship, well she was in a relationship That is verbally emotionally and physically abusive so I of course offered her a place to stay here. Well that did not sit well with my ex wife She basically told Brittany the friend that she needs to get out. her and the baby need to get out. They have nowhere to go. She doesn't care. So now I'm worried sick about these two out there. She did call me and say that she did find a friend to stay with tonight but I'm just so God Damn upset about this! That my ex can't have any compassion towards others. It's really driving me crazy. I gotta get the Fuck outta here I just need to make some money so I can get my own place and get out of here as soon as possible. Well that's where I'm at now so I will keep you up to date on tomorrow's activities.
